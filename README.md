My the biggest project created for football fans. In this app you can add memes and see memes of other users but when you have added mem then administrator have to accept it(or discard). You can check league tables of the most important leagues in Europa. There is live chat for logged users where they can have a discussion together and in next tab you can see football matches for the current day. You can add your own profile avatar and change it if you want.
